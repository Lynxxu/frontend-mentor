# Front-end mentor solutions by Lynx

Hi!

I'm Lynx, currently trying to use my knowledge of web development in actual projects, and this is a repo for all the solutions of [**frontend mentor**](https://www.frontendmentor.io). You can find the corresponding solutions in `pages/posts`

The tech stack used here are next.js, React.js and tailwindcss. If anyone come across this little project, please let me know if there's any problem with my code.
