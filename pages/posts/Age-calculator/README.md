# A simple QR code by React, next and tailwindcss

Hi!

I'm Lynx, currently self-studying web development. This is one try on front-end mentor's second challenege. This calcultor was implemented with React, tailwind and next.js. It is fairly responsive and works well with most devices by using media queries.

However, during this process, I found myself having a very hard time controlling the layout while making the project responsive. Initially I thought that the main function that calculates the age and updates the output is the hardest, but it turns out to be the easiest. Making the app responsive by tailwind is troublesome and much harder than I thought.
